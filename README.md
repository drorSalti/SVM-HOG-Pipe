# SVM-HOG-Pipe
Computer Vision project- Implement an E2E pipe with SVM+HOG.
The goal was to classify photos into 10 classes- dataset from CalTech101 - http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/.
The pipe that I chose was SVM+HOG.
All the code is provided in a .py file. In addition I provide an Hebrew report (PDF).
